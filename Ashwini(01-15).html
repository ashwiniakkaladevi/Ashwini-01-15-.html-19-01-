        <h4 class="A" align="center">The Rise of Strategic Thinking</h4><hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
       
            <p>The concept of strategy was born in military campaigns whose results, whether<br>
                good or bad, were largely the product of the minds of strategists. From ancient<br>
                times, much has been said about great military commanders and their strategies.
                </p>
            <p>The word strategic comes from the Greek <i>stratego,</i> which literally means<br>
                general. In the classic division of war into operational, tactical, and strategic<br>
                aspects, strategy is linked to planning, to the broader environment and the<br>
                longest time frame. Even though its meaning has changed over time, since the<br>
                Napoleonic wars it has encompassed military, political and economic dimensions.<br>
                </p>
            <p>The first writings that contain thoughts about what today we would call strategic<br>
                thinking go back to antiquity, authored by Greeks and Romans. Even in the<br>
                Bible, there are passages where one can perceive the strategies used to win<br>
                conflicts. Perhaps the oldest text that deals systematically with this matter is<br>
                “The art of war,” written by Sun Tzu (1983) of China in the fourth century, B.C.<br>
                This book appeared in the West in the 18th century and became well<br>
                disseminated by the end of the 20th century. At the time the text was written,</p>
                <hr><hr>
            <p>China was the scene of constant warring among feudal lords. Sun Tzu traveled<br>
                throughout the country disseminating his teachings, as a kind of consultant<br>
                (Hurst, 2001). <i>The Art of War</i> deals with principles of a general nature, which<br>
                aid a sovereign in winning wars. For Sun Tzu, the art of war is governed by five<br>
                factors:
                </p>
            <p>• &nbsp;  <b class="bold">Moral Law:</b>the degree to which the people are dedicated to and trust<br>
                &nbsp;  &nbsp;  their government;<br>
                •  &nbsp;  <b class="bold">The Sky:</b>the climatic conditions;<br>
                • &nbsp;   <b class="bold">The Earth:</b> the conditions of the land, of distances;<br>
                •  &nbsp;  <b class="bold">The Chief:</b> represents the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence,<br>
                &nbsp;   &nbsp;  courage, and righteousness;<br>
                • &nbsp;   <b class="bold">The Method and discipline:</b> the correct deployment of the army,<br>
                &nbsp;  &nbsp;  supplies and cost controls.</p>
            <p>The book strongly emphasizes the need for generals to know themselves and<br>
                their adversaries well, which is summed up in the phrase: “If you know your<br>
                enemy, you do not need to fear the result of a hundred battles.” Another aspect<br>
                that he stresses is the importance of avoiding direct confrontation, where force<br>
                meets force. On the contrary, the adversary should be convinced to not to want<br>
                to fight: “The greatest merit consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without<br>
                fighting.” Sun Tzu’s writings had a lot of influence on the thinking of business<br>
                people and there are several extensions of his ideas which focus on different<br>
                aspects of business in the literature. His influence was particularly important for<br>
                authors seeking guidelines and declarations of principle devoted to business<br>
                strategy. Among the most noteworthy are the authors who originated a school<br>
                of strategic thought called the “school of positioning” which flourished in the<br>
                1980s, and in which Michael Porter is usually included. This and other schools<br>
                of strategic thinking will be examined later in this chapter.</p>
            <p>Niccolo Machiavelli’s most famous work, <i>The Prince</i> (Maquiavel, 1976), was<br>
                a kind of manual of politic science, written in the 16th century. This was during<br>
                the Italian Renaissance, a time of extreme turbulence, when kingdoms were<br>
                warring among themselves and many struggled to govern them. Machiavelli’s<br>
                thinking, often expressed in the “Machiavellian” phrase “the ends justify the<br>
                means”, had broad repercussions in political and military thought over the years<br>
                and in 20th century business ideas as well. Notions about how to form alliances<br>
                and to deal with enemies appear throughout his work: “The prince should</p>
                <hr><hr>
            <p>become the chief and protector of his less powerful neighbors, work to weaken<br>
                the stronger and avoid the entry of a prince stronger than he at all costs”.<br>
                Machiavelli exalted governors who were alert and ready to fight decisively:<br>
                “Princes lose their states when they dedicate themselves more to voluptuous-<br>
                ness than to arms.” Audacity is another virtue he extols in his work: “I am of the<br>
                opinion that it is better to be daring than prudent”.</p>
            <p>Machiavelli influenced not just politics but business literature as well, especially<br>
                in recommendations for executive actions. This vision is found among thinkers<br>
                included in the “school of entrepreneurship,” which highlights the role of the<br>
                (CEO – <i>Chief Executive Officer</i>) in formulating strategy</p>
            <p>The concept of strategy focused on military matters arose in the 18th century<br>
                amidst the valorization of thought which oriented the ideas of Illuminism.</p>
            <p>Influenced by the success of scientific principles in explaining physical phenom-<br>
                ena, theoreticians examined military successes with the same criteria, trying to<br>
                distill the principles of strategy</p>
            <p>These theoreticians were influenced by Frederick the Great of Prussia who was<br>
                successful with small, well-trained armies. Scholars of the time perceived<br>
                mathematical and geometric principles in these victories.</p>
            <p>However, at the end of the 18th century, Napoleon’s armies crushed the armies<br>
                mounted along Prussian lines, disorienting theoreticians who struggled to<br>
                explain what had happened in order to create new principles.
                </p>
            <p>In this context, two theoreticians who studied Napoleon’s successes arose: the<br>
                Prussian general Karl von Clausewitz (1780-1831), still famous today both in<br>
                military and business circles, and the French-Swiss general Antoine-Henri de<br>
                Jomini (1779-1869), who although very influential in his day, has now been
                nearly forgotten.</p>
            <p>Of those who wrote interpretively and contemporaneously of Napoleon’s<br>
                successes, Von Clausewitz’s works had the greatest impact on concepts of<br>
                military strategy. His main contributions were in understanding the relationship<br>
                between theory and practice and his vision of war as a dynamic process. For<br>
                him, strategic theory should have a descriptive rather than prescriptive nature,<br>
                i.e. there is no “recipe” for strategic success; rather it is possible to learn from<br>
                observing outside experiences. The study of strategy, with a descriptive focus,<br>
                aids in training the judgment and intuition of the commanders, but it cannot be<br>
                used as a basis for action, since command is seen as something essentially<br>
                creative. Decisions have to be made quickly in situations which are essentially<br>
                unique and thus it would be hard to prescribe actions beforehand. On the other</p>
                <hr><hr>
            <p>hand, the commander who learns from former experiences can use them in a<br>
                rational or even intuitive manner to make better and faster decisions.</p>
            <p>Clausewitz’s book, <i>On War,</i> has been used by military academies since its<br>
                publications and as business literature since the 1980s.</p>
            <p>Curiously, de Jomini was more influential in his time than Von Clausewitz.<br>
                Today, however, few remember his ideas. For Jomini, there were scientific<br>
                principles of military strategy that not only should be prescribed, but should <br>
                followed. Since there were many commanders who were avid to discover the<br>
                secrets of Napoleon’s military successes, the idea that they could be trans-<br>
                formed into a collection of recipes, which could be used repeatedly, was<br>
                extremely attractive. His was, therefore, a prescriptive approach. De Jomini<br>
                considered that the principles of war were always valid, independently of the<br>
                situation or the technology employed. His ideas remained in vogue in military<br>
                circles until the beginning of the 20th century</p>
            <p>However, with the advent of World War I, the reality of its bloody combat<br>
                overthrew his “immutable principles.” In his writings, de Jomini defended the<br>
                effectiveness of massive frontal attacks and argued that this was valid indepen-<br>
                dently of the technology employed. These ideas of direct attacks had their basis<br>
                in the era of muskets and became a lot more expensive with the advent of<br>
                repeating rifles. But with machine guns, widely disseminated in the first world<br>
                war, direct attacks became prohibitive (to illustrate, there were more than a<br>
                million casualties just between the Battles of Somme and Verdun). Therefore<br>
                technology deeply affected the supposed validity of his principles.</p>
            <p>Ideas of military strategy were transposed to the business world during the<br>
                second half of the 20th century, and the use of the same concepts and terms was<br>
                common</p>
            <p>The use of analogy, especially taking cases from military strategy, is very<br>
                frequent in the study of business. Nevertheless, there should be a certain<br>
                caution since this is a resource to facilitate comprehension that should not be<br>
                taken literally. As was said regarding Von Clausewitz, analogies should be used<br>
                as a source of inspiration.
                </p>
            <p>The lines of thinking of the previously cited authors, von Clausewitz and de<br>
                Jomini, influenced the rise of currents of strategic thinking devoted to the world<br>
                of business. They can be grouped generically in two ways: descriptive and<br>
                prescriptive. Alternating between these two basic ideas, Mintzberg, Ahlstrand<br>
                and Lampel (1998) identified 10 different currents of strategic business thinking<br>
                detailed in the following.</p>

        <h4 class="A" align="center">Investigating the Concept of Strategy</h4> <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
        
            <p>What is understood by strategy has not remained the same over time, but has<br>
                run a long course to arrive at the present. What factors should be considered<br>
                in developing a strategy? How to analyze these factors? How to develop a<br>
                strategy? Should strategy be planned or generated as facts develop? How to<br>
                view strategy? Is there a recipe for successful strategies? These questions, and<br>
                others that come up, will be discussed in this chapter and in this book.</p>
            <p>Strategy as a subject for business arose in the 1950s and flourished in the 60s,<br>
                70s and 80s. There was a period of apogee, and with the birth of the so-called<br>
                “New Economy”, it came to be strongly questioned. Then with the develop-<br>
                ments in the wake of the bankruptcy of the Internet companies it came back into<br>
                view. From all we have seen up to now, the importance of having a better<br>
                understanding of strategy is clear.</p>
            <p>The concept of strategy, in business as well as the military realm where it<br>
                originated, has several approaches and remains in constant evolution. There are<br>
                different ways to understand strategic thinking. Thus, definitions of strategy will<br>
                be different. Instead of trying to define strategy, various factors within the<br>
                concept of strategy and various views on the subject will be presented.</p>
       
        <h4 class="A" >The Evolution of Strategic Thinking</h4> <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
        
            <p>We have already seen how the concept of strategy had a military origin and two<br>
                of the thinkers who had a major influence on strategic theory: von Clausewitz,<br>
                who adopted the descriptive approach and de Jomini whose writings are of a<br>
                prescriptive nature.
                </p>
            <p>According to Hurst (2001) there is a continuum of strategic thinking that ranges<br>
                from description to prescription, the two basic ideas presented earlier. In this<br>
                context, Mintzberg & Lampel (1999) listed 10 different “schools” in one of the<br>
                most well-known taxonomies about strategic thinking. For them, they signify<br>
                different processes for determining strategy—all parts of the same process.</p>
            <p>Among the schools of thought that formulate analytic and prescriptive strategy<br>
                (the <i>“ought to” </i>schools, which aim to instruct), Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and<br>
                Lampel locate the following Design, Planning, and Positioning</p>
        
        <p><b> Design (Strategy as a process of conception).</b> This school views the<br>
            &nbsp;   process of forming strategy essentially as a fit between strengths and<br>
            &nbsp;   weaknesses and threats and opportunities from the external environment.<br>
            &nbsp;   This was the dominant thinking in the 60s, and beginning of the 70s.<br>
            &nbsp;   Among the representative authors of this school are Philip Selznick,<br>
            &nbsp;   Alfred Chandler, and Ken Andrews.<br>
            <b>Planning (Strategy as a formal process)</b>. Developed concomitantly<br>
             &nbsp;   with the school of Design, the school of Planning came into being with Igor<br>
             &nbsp;    Ansoff in 1965, and had its apogee in the 70s. Russell L. Ackoff is another<br>
             &nbsp;    representative author of this school. Although it lost some importance at<br>
             &nbsp;    the beginning of the 80s, it remains an important school.<br>
             <b>Positioning (Strategy as an analytical process).</b> The school of<br>
             &nbsp;    Positioning predominated in the 1980s, thanks mainly to the work of<br>
             &nbsp;  Michael Porter. This is descended directly from the ideas about military<br>
             &nbsp;   strategy of various authors, among them Sun Tzu. It is based on the idea<br>
             &nbsp; that strategy can be reduced to some generic positions, which can be<br>
             &nbsp; identified by analyzing the situation of the industry (industry here used in<br>
             &nbsp;   the sense of a sector of activities). In this view, the strategist is, above all,<br>
             &nbsp;an analyst</p><br>
             <p>Among the<i> schools of thought about formulating strategy of a descriptive<br>
                 nature </i>(the "is" schools) which seek to inspire the imagination rather than to<br>
                 instruct, Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel (1998) list the following: Entrepre-<br>
                 neurship, Cognition, Learning, Power, Culture, Environment, and Configura-<br>
                 tion.</p>
             <p> <b>Entrepreneurship (Strategy as a visionary process).</b> Like the Design<br>
                 school the school of Entrepreneurship focuses the process on the CEO-<br>
                <i> Chief Executive Officer.</i> However, in a very different manner, it bases<br>
                 the process of creative intuition in a visionary leader and in the capacity<br>
                 to control and implement his/her ideas.<br>
            <p><b> Cognitive (Strategy as a mental process).</b> This school appeared in the<br>
                 80s and is still developing today. It is based on the ability to understand<br>
                 people's mental processes and how reality is perceived. More recently,<br>
                 the focus has been on a more subjective, interpretive, or constructivist<br>
                 approach to creating strategy.<br>
                 </p>
                 <hr><hr>
                 <p><b>Learning (Strategy as an emerging process).</b>Developing in parallel<br>
                     &nbsp;  with other schools, and in a certain sense taking on a position of<br>
                     &nbsp;   challenging the dominant school at every turn, it has an incremental view<br>
                     &nbsp;  of implementing strategy. Strategy is seen as an emerging process,<br>
                     &nbsp;   strategists can be present everywhere in the company, and the formulation<br>
                     &nbsp;    and implementation of strategy are not separate.<br>
                     <b> Power (Strategy as a negotiating process).</b> In this school, not among<br>
                     &nbsp;  the largest, strategy is based on power. In a micro approach, power is<br>
                     &nbsp;   viewed as being internally disputed in the companies in a natural political<br>
                     &nbsp;   process involving negotiation, persuasion, and bargaining. In a macro<br>
                     &nbsp; approach, it views the company as an entity that uses its power over others<br>
                     &nbsp;   to form partnerships, joint ventures, or other interrelationships to negoti-<br>
                     &nbsp;  ate collective strategies in its own interest.<br>
                     <b> Cultural (Strategy as a social process).</b> This school, equally small,<br>
                     &nbsp;   considers strategy as a social process based in culture that has to do with<br>
                     &nbsp;   common interests and integration. Most of the schoolâ€™s writings have to<br>
                     &nbsp;   do with the influence of culture as inhibitors of more important strategic<br>
                     &nbsp;   changes.<br>
                     <b> Environmental (Strategy as a reactive process).</b> This school seeks to<br>
                     &nbsp;  understand the degree of freedom a company has to move within its<br>
                     &nbsp;    environment, as well as to understand the demands it makes on the<br>
                     &nbsp;   organizations. Included here are Contingency Theory (which studies the<br>
                     &nbsp;  expected responses of companies under certain environmental condi-<br>
                     &nbsp;  tions) and Institutional Theory (which studies the institutional pressures<br>
                     &nbsp; organizations face).<br>
                     <b>Configuration (Strategy as a process of transformation).</b> This is the<br>

                                                 <p>The need for strategy is linked to the existence of competition, whether to win<br>
                                                     a war or to conquer the market. But this is a necessary condition and is not<br>
                                                     sufficient to explain what strategy is.<br>
 
                                                     There is competition among species in nature for survival, but we canâ€™t speak<br>
                                                     of a strategy for natural selection. The random variations produced in species<br>
                                                     will adapt differently to the environment and only the best adapted will survive.<br>
                                                     Speaking of the processes of nature, it is interesting to note that Gauseâ€™s<br>
                                                     â€œprinciple of competitive exclusionâ€ can be verified in experimentation with<br>
                                                     elementary living beings. According to this principle, when beings of the same<br>
                                                     species are isolated in an environment with limited resources, none of them<br>
                                                     survive. However, if there are beings from different species, survival is possible.<br>
                                                     In other words, two species that compete in an identical manner cannot exist<br>
                                                     in the same environment. The richer the environment is in terms of resources,<br>
                                                     the more species there will be, and also more competition (Henderson, 1989).<br>

                                                     what happens in the business world?<br>
 
                                                     As in nature, in the business environment, there cannot be companies compet-<br>
                                                     ing in the same way for the same market, even thought this is not evident at the<br>
                                                     first glance.<br>
 
                                                     Therefore, there is a similarity here.<br>
 
                                                     However competition existed before strategy. But there is a basic difference<br>
                                                     between natural competition and strategy. Natural competition is evolutionary,<br>
                                                     governed by the laws of probability; strategy is revolutionary, governed by<br>

                                                        sense of making deliberate interventions.</p>
                                                    <p>Thus for Henderson (1989), strategy is a deliberate search for a plan of action<br>
                                                        that will develop a competitive advantage for the business and putting this plan<br>
                                                        into practice.</p>
                                                    <p>This search necessarily begins with an understanding of whom and where you<br>
                                                        are and that your goal is to increase the scope of the advantage a company will<br>
                                                        have in competing for the market.</p>
                                                    <p>Note that strategy has two perspectives: that of a plan, and also the execution<br>
                                                        of this plan. This view is also defended by Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel<br>
                                                        (1998). For these authors, strategy is a plan for directing activities toward a<br>
                                                        future: those who develop it desire to shape favorably for themselves. On the<br>
                                                        other hand, there is the notion that strategy is equally linked to the execution of<br>
                                                        the plan, to what really was done. Thus, these authors understand that strategy<br>
                                                        is a pattern that is followed in a consistent way over time.</p><br>

                                                    <p>Efficiency is a measure of the performance of the process of conversion of<br>
                                                        inputs into outputs, while effectiveness is a measure of the degree to which the<br>
                                                        outputs satisfy requirements. Efficiency is related with “doing things in the right<br>
                                                        way”, such as using resources well, with a focus internal to activities. Effective-<br>ness is related to “doing the right things” obtaining results in accord with goals,<br>
                                                        with a focus on the outside environment (Drucker, 1963; Laurindo, Carvalho,<br>
                                                        and Shimizu, 2003).</p>
                                                    <p>For Porter (1996), operational efficiency means executing similar activities<br>
                                                        better than the competitors. To achieve efficiency, several managerial tools<br>
                                                        have been developed, for example TQM (total quality management),<br>
                                                        benchmarking, outsourcing, partnering, and reengineering. These tools are<br>
                                                        important in a competitive environment; however they are not sufficient to<br>
                                                        replace a company’s strategy.</p>
                                                    <p>On the other hand, a strategic position means carrying out activities which are<br>
                                                        different from those of rivals or to execute similar activities in a different way.<br>
                                                        One of the problems of focusing just on operational efficiency is the fact that few<br>
                                                        companies manage to compete successfully for an extended period of time if<br>
                                                        they base themselves in this aspect. Therefore, operational efficiency is not<br>
                                                        enough, since there is rapid dissemination of the best practices, which are<br>
                                                        replicable by other companies and which become commercialized products. A<br>
                                                        second reason is because the larger the number of companies that adopt<br>
                                                        practices such as benchmarking and outsourcing or any other tool, the more<br>
                                                        they become similar, thus making it impossible for some of them to stand out<br>
                                                        among the rest and thus they leave the field vanquished.</p>

                                                <p>Porter argues that a generalized focus on operational efficiency explains the<br>
                                                    wave of consolidations and mergers in certain industries. Since the companies<br>
                                                    lack a strategic vision and base themselves solely on an evaluation of opera<br>tional performance, they do not find an option for growth other than buying,<br>
                                                    being bought, or merging.</p>
                                                <p>In turn, Campbell and Alexander (1997) argue that often strategic planning<br>
                                                    does not result in effective action. For them, this is the result of failing to<br>
                                                    understand what it means to develop strategy.</p>
                                                <p>First, they argue that there is a failure to differentiate between purposes and<br>
                                                    constraints. Purposes are the reason for the organization’s existence, what the<br>
                                                    company desires to do. Constraints are what an organization needs to do to<br>
                                                    survive. Another problem resides in how a company can implement strategy.<br>
                                                    Finally, there is the expectation that good planning will result in better strategies.<br>
                                                    For these authors, however, developing a good strategy should be based in a<br>
                                                    real understanding of the benefits to the company of having well established<br>
                                                    purposes, as well as in seeking to generate greater value than its competitors.</p> 
                                                <p>Another issue that Campbell and Alexander point out is the definition of<br>
                                                    company goals, which directly affects the development of strategy. Statements<br>
                                                    about providing shareholders with a higher return; increasing value to clients;<br>
                                                    higher-than-market-levels salaries and carrier opportunities for their collabo-<br>rators do not help to define strategy, because they are just new ways of stating<br>
                                                    the universal goal of all companies to develop and maintain competitive<br>
                                                    advantage. Many executives erroneously believe that satisfying the stakehold-<br>ers is a goal that leads to correct strategy; generating value for the stakeholders<br>
                                                    is not an objective, but an economic constraint on a company’s actions. The<br>
                                                    reason for this is that companies will not have the loyalty of their stakeholders<br>
                                                    (clients, stockholders, suppliers, and collaborators) if these do not perceive<br>
                                                    that the company is adding a value at least equal to that provided by its<br>
                                                    competitors. Achieving objectives depends on managers’ ability to develop<br>
                                                    appropriate strategies, since if they can’t establish a strategy, the goals will be<br>
                                                    discarded as nonviable. Similarly, these authors contend that a strategy is only<br>
                                                    viable if there are tactical actions that make its implementation possible.</p>
                                                <p>Christensen (1997) stresses that another problem in elaborating strategy lies in<br>
                                                    the fact that this activity is not usually exercised every day, which means that it<br>
                                                    is not at the heart of the executives’ daily activities. Strategy should be coherent<br>
                                                    with the environment of the company and company resources should be aligned<br>
                                                    with executing this strategy. Christensen believes that, in general, there is a<br>
                                                    deficiency in the connection and alignment between the process of conceiving<br>
                                                    strategy and the process of implementing it.</p>

                                                <p>Porter’s (1996) view that strategy differs fundamentally from the search for<br>

                                                    the idea that changes of an incremental nature are not enough for the success<br>
                                                    of a strategy for the majority of companies. Small cost reductions and marginal<br>
                                                    improvements in quality and in delivery times are some of Hamel’s examples of<br>
                                                    incrementalism. All these implicitly seek operational efficiency. The author<br>
                                                    states that making strategy implies assuming more revolutionary postures,<br>
                                                    which can affect the way companies operate in a more significant manner.</p>

                                                    understand the difference between strategy and strategic planning. Hamel<br>
                                                    affirms that strategic planning in general is not in fact strategic, since he<br>
                                                    interprets the traditional processes for developing strategy to obliterate the<br>
                                                    revolutionary stance which he advocates. Strategy should be a result of<br>
                                                    “revolutionary” and “subversive” processes that are easier to find in small<br>
                                                    companies, which are not the traditional market leaders. The leaders define the<br>
                                                    rules in force for an industry, but revolutionary companies have the potential to<br>
                                                    reinvent these rules.</p>
                                                <p>It is necessary to distinguish strategy from the quest for operational efficiency,<br>
                                                    as well as to understand the differences that separate the concepts of strategy<br>

                                                <p>For Porter (1996), a competitive strategy means choosing a different arrange-<br>ment of activities to deliver a package of unique value, thus staking out a<br>
                                                    strategic position. Strategic positioning can be realized based in three distinct<br>
                                                    sources that are not mutually exclusive: the variety of products and services,<br>
                                                    meeting the needs of a certain group of consumers, and the particularities of<br>
                                                    accessibility of a specific group of consumers.</p>
                                                <p>For positioning based on the variety of products and services, the main idea is<br>
                                                    to chose a range of products and services to be offered and to develop activities<br>
                                                    which will allow them to be produced in the best way possible.</p>
                                                <p>When positioning is based on the needs of a group of consumers, differences<br>
                                                    in terms of obtaining an advantageous positioning only occur when the set of<br>
                                                    activities that allows specific services is also differentiated. Note that these<br>
                                                    specific needs can be anything from a greater sensitivity to price, to products</p>

                                                    meaningful position, unless the arrangement of activities to satisfy clients is also<br>
                                                    different.</p>
                                                <p>Differences in accessibility can lead to strategic positioning, even when<br>
                                                    consumer needs are not different from those of other customers, but when the<br>
                                                    means to reach customers demands a differentiated set of activities. This can<br>
                                                    occur due to geographic factors, the scale of production, or other factors which<br>
                                                    require a specific manner of accessing customers.</p>
                                                <p>For Porter therefore, within this context, the essence of strategy is the creation<br>
                                                    of a unique, valuable position, involving the choice of an internal arrangement<br>
                                                    of activities that allows the company to differentiate itself from its rivals.</p>
                                                <p>In a similar fashion, Markides (1999) understands the essence of strategy to lie<br>
                                                    in the company’s choosing a position that it can sustain as its own. In addition,<br>
                                                    developing strategy is a process of elaborating questions, generating alterna-<br>tives, and making choices.</p>

                                                    manner. The strategic positioning of companies comes from their responses to<br>
                                                    these three questions, and if they are differentiated, will lead the companies to<br>
                                                    success.</p>
                                                <p>Choosing a unique position still is not sufficient to guarantee a sustainable<br>
                                                    advantage, since the competitors can imitate this behavior and aim at the same<br>
                                                    strategic positioning. However, in assuming some options, the companies have<br>
                                                    to let go of others, under the risk of not being successful in any of them.<br>
                                                    Therefore, equilibrium between exclusive alternatives (trade-offs) must be<br>
                                                    sought, without which the companies will not arrive at a sustainable advantage.</p>
                                                <p>The need for these trade-offs is based in three reasons for Porter: to maintain<br>
                                                    consistency in image or reputation, compatibility with the nature of the activities<br>
                                                    themselves, and limitations on internal coordination and in the control of<br>

                                                <p>To maintain a consistent image or reputation, it is important that customers not<br>
                                                    be confused, but perceive that they always receive the same kind of value.<br>
